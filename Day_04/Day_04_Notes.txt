                ****Dictionary And Sets In Python *****
The Dictionary is builint_ data type in python which store the data which having different datatype (string, list , tupple, int , boolean, float) in form of Key:value. (key is word and value is the the data.)

properties of Dictionary:
1. mutable (changeable)

2. unordered (no rule which thing will come first like string will be declare first or int no such things)

3. Unique (Two keys can not have same names like, we can not create to keys having same name "age")
it is mutable , unordered and unique(no duplication)

Syntax:

dic_name = {
    key:value
}

student= {
    "name" :john, : string
    "class" :      5  , :int
    "grade" :"A" , : string
    "Percentage" : 80.90,: flaot
}


Note: the keys should be constant that should not change in future like list, we can add and remove element from list so we can not make the list as key.

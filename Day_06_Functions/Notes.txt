                Funtions
Funtions are block of statements that are used to perform a specific task.
we write a block of codes and then call it again and again ( reusability)
instead of writing code again and again for same task.

for exampl 
we want to make a calculator so for sum we can make a function and whenever the user wants to add two numbers he will call that function for sum instead of writing code for same task(sum in this case) again and again.

Benefits:
Reusability.
Time saving.
Efforts saving.

Syntax:

def fun_name(para1 , para2 ..., paran):
   lines of code:

Calling function:
fun_name(argument1 , argument2, .... , argumentn)

: Note: in function defination parameter is variable and the function call the argument is the actual value that we want to give as input to get some specific output:

for sum:
def sum_fun(a , b)
result = a+b
print(result)


Now if we want to again plus two numbers we don't need to write the code again. we will just call the above function:

sum_fun(4 , 8) : 4 and 8 are called argument which sum is required:


Types of function:

Built_in_function : that are predifined already like print , input etc
user_define_function : that are defined by users just like above.

Class And Objects:

Syntax:

class Classname:
objectname = value

Details:
class : class is the keyword for creating class.
Clssname: it can be any variable and it should be start with capital letter.
objectname: it can be the name of anything related to class data
value : value is the data that would be store in the objectname variable.

For example:

class Student:
age = 12

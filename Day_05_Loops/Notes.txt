break: it end the loop if certain condition met without completing the iteration.

continue: it has also similar functionalities of break but it is just used to terminate single iteration then continue the execution.

for example:
we want to print numbers from 0 to 3

i = 0
while(i<=5):
if(i==2):

continue
print(i)

Note: when the i value equals to 2 the print and i+=1 statement will get ignored and control will shift to the start of while loop
This key word is used to skip something

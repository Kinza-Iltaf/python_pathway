            Topic: Lists And Tuples
01. question
what is list and tuples?
list is built-in data type that store diferent type of data like int, float, string and boolean.
Tuples are also list but it is immutable(unchangable) and at time of initialization we use paranthesis instead of square brackets.
Syntax:
listname = [value1, value2,.....value_n]        
Note:list are mutable  
we can change the value at any index.
for example:
list = [1,3,5,6]
now at index[0] there is 1 so in list we can change this value by index number
list[0] = 8  
now at index there will be 8 instead of 1 so that's why the list is called mutalbe(changealbe) unlike string where we can only access the value and can not change.


02. list slicing:
list slicing is used to access the particular part of the list.
Syntax:
listname[starting_index:ending_index]


03. list Methods (functions)

01: list.append()
it add one element at the end of the list.
for example we have student name list and one student take admission after month so we can append his name to that list through append method.
For example:
student = [fawad, arham, talal]
student.append(hasham)

02: list.sort()
It arranging the list in acsendig order.
Syntax: 
list.sort() : in accending order
list.sort(reverse=true) : in decending order

03: list.reverse()
it return the list in opposite starting_index

04: list.insert(index,value)
this function insert value at specific index given in function bracket

05: list.remove(value which we want to remove)
it remove the first occurance of the list

06: list.pop(index)
This method remove the value at particular index in list

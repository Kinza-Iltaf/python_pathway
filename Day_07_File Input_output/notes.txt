            File input and output:
Python can be used to perform operation on file. 
Operation on file means opening file, reading file , creating file, making changes in file and so more.  

There are Two major Types of files.
1. Text file: in which we store the data in form of characters.
for example:
.txt , docx , ppp,  .log etc

2. Binary file: where we store data other than text format.
mp4 , mov , png , jpg etc.

Basic Operation on file:

1. opening file:
opening file means open that file for any other operation like writing , reading , append , updating , deletion etc.

Format for opening file:

f = open("fileName.txt", "mode") 

here 
f : is a variable that create object for file
fileName: it is the name of your file you want to open.
mode: it show the mode like for which operation you want to open the file for example for read for which we write "r", for writing we write "w" for 




Modes in File:
r : for reading data from file
w : for removing all data and writting new data in file
x : creating new file and writing data in that file
a : open for writing and adding data at the end of the file.
b : it is used for binary file operation 
t : it is used for text file operation
+ : it is used for two operation simultaneously. like reading and writting

Reading file:

first open the file.
content = f.read()

now if we want to read some specific part in file like first 10 letters then we pass the length.

like:
content = f. read(10)

Reading file line by line:

line1 = f.readline()

so it will read first line in file.
